# Distributed Algorithms Assignments

## About

This repository is dedicated to assignments given by professor [Markus Endler](https://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~endler/) in the Distributed Algorithms course ([INF2056](https://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~endler/courses/DA/index.html)) at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/) during the 1st semester of 2022.
Every assignment will consist of implementating some distributed algorithm on Sinalgo (written in Java). I'll be using Sinalgo version 0.75.3 (which can be obtained on [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sinalgo/) Sourceforge page) simply because I could not manager to run the newer versions on Eclipse. :-)
