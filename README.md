# Distributed Algorithms Assignments

## About

This repository is dedicated to assignments given by professor [Markus Endler](https://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~endler/) in the Distributed Algorithms course ([INF2056](https://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~endler/courses/DA/index.html)) at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/) during the 1st semester of 2022.
Every assignment will consist of implementating some distributed algorithm on Sinalgo (see "Credits" section). I'll be using Sinalgo version 0.75.3 (which can be obtained on [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sinalgo/) Sourceforge page) simply because I could not manage to run the newer versions on Eclipse. :-)

## Credits

![algo](src/sinalgo/images/appIcon.gif) Sinalgo was developed by the [Distributed Computing Group](http://disco.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/).
