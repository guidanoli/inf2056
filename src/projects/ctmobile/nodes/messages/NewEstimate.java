/**
 * This message carries the estimate proposed by the coordinator to the base stations.
 * When the coordinator of round r has gathered a majority of estimates, it selects one
 * estimate from its local buffer Log_c[r] and sends it as a new estimate to all base stations.
 * The selected estimate is either the new estimate sent by a previous coordinator which
 * failed to gather a majority of positive acknowledgments or the set of values New_V_c of the
 * current coordinator. While a base station MSS_i is waiting for a new estimate V_c, it asks
 * its failure detector module whether the current coordinator has crashed or not. If the
 * NEW_EST message is received before the coordinator is suspected and if it carries at least
 * a participant mobile hosts, the base station updates its set of values V_i to V_c and
 * replies with a positive acknowledgment. Otherwise it replies with a negative acknowledgment
 * and next updates its sets New_V_i and Pi. See actions 11 and 12.
