/**
 * This message carries the estimate proposed by a base station MSS_i to the current coordinator MSS_c.
 * Each estimate is tagged with a time stamp ts_i identifying the round during which MSS_i has updated
 * its estimate for the last time (see action 12). During round r, MSS_i sends a first ESTIMATE message
 * during action 10. Other ESTIMATE messages can be sent during action 5 when MSS_i updates its collection
 * of values. The estimates sent during round r to MSS_c (MSS_c is necessarily the coordinator of round r),
 * are gathered and logged in a local buffer Log_c[r]. A base station MSSi can propose multiple estimates
 * during a round r but the coordinator MSS_c keeps only the most recent estimate sent by MSS_i during round r.
 * The statement Log_c[r] := Log_c[r] @ (MSS_i,r, V_i,ts_i) executed in action 7 is equivalent to two
 * successive operations: (1) Log_c[r] := Log_c[r] U { (MSS_i,r,V_i',ts_i)} and (2) if there exists
 * (MSS_i,r,V_i',ts_i) E Log_c[r] and (MSS_i,r,V_i'',ts_i) E Log_c[r] such that card(V_i') <= card(V_i"),
 * then (MSS_i,r,V_i', ts_i) is removed from Log_c[r].
